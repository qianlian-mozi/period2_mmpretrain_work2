actually, with such fruit30 dataset's format, we can juse use the repo called "split-folders", just take easy to install as bellow:

pip install split-folders

and here is the usage of this function: 

Usage:
    splitfolders [--output] [--ratio] [--fixed] [--seed] [--oversample] [--group_prefix] folder_with_images
Options:
    --output        path to the output folder. defaults to `output`. Get created if non-existent.
    --ratio         the ratio to split. e.g. for train/val/test `.8 .1 .1 --` or for train/val `.8 .2 --`.
    --fixed         set the absolute number of items per validation/test set. The remaining items constitute
                    the training set. e.g. for train/val/test `100 100` or for train/val `100`.
    --seed          set seed value for shuffling the items. defaults to 1337.
    --oversample    enable oversampling of imbalanced datasets, works only with --fixed.
    --group_prefix  split files into equally-sized groups based on their prefix
